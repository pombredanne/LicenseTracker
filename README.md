LicenseTracker
==============

Default account:
To get you started, there will be one account already in the system- Username "admin" password "admin".

The purpose of this account is for approving the initial user requests, after which you can use those new accounts for approving or denying users. 

As this default account is both extremely guessable and in this text file that is downloadable by anyone, you will be prompted to change your password upon first logging in.
