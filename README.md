Installation:
To get started, you will need to download and install Python 2.7.8 and Django 1.6.5, available here:

Python download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Choose version 2.7.8! (or, if not there, the version that starts with a "2")

and here

Django download: https://www.djangoproject.com/download/
(run "pip install Django==1.6.5" in your computer's command prompt)

Follow all installation instructions (also available on the websites).


Download this project, and move into a folder of your choosing.

Congratulations! You've installed things.

==============

Customization:
There are a few settings you can change right-off-the-bat. Edit the "settings.py" file in the "web", and enter information about your company name, company email, and the likes.

==============

Running server:
Using your computer's command line, go into this program's main folder (named "web" by default) and run "python manage.py runserver"
If everything was installed correctly, the server should now be running.

==============

Default account:
To get you started, there will be one account already in the system- Username "admin" password "admin".

The purpose of this account is for approving the initial user requests, after which you can use those new accounts for approving or denying users. 

As this default account is both extremely guessable and in this text file that is downloadable by anyone, you will be prompted to change your password upon first logging in, and every time after. It is not recommended to use this account later in the website's lifespan, just for setting up new approver accounts that can in turn do everything.
